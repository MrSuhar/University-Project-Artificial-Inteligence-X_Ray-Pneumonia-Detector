# University-Project-Artificial-Inteligence-X_Ray-Pneumonia-Detector

Creators: Bartosz K. (mrsuhar) && Krzystof M. (kmarcinek2k) </br>

The aim of this project is to create AI that recognizes the victims of penumonia based on their chest X-Ray images.</br>

Project was created using Python (utilising Anaconda package manager, Tensorflow Library and Jupyter Notebook).</br>

TO DO LIST: </br>
1.Setup Environment DONE</br>
-->Open Google Collab</br>
2.Train AI in few epochs.
